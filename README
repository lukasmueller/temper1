For more information on SSL's work on the TEMPer1 devices on OS X
and Linux visit http://ssl-lab.blogspot.com/

This utility is a rewrite of the basic utility
  https://github.com/ssllab/temper

Improvements from the basic utility
- Multiple devices support (all devices or specific device)
- Configuration file for per-port calibration
- Unit selection (C, F, K)

Planned features:
- Daemon mode with timed sample intervals
- Configurable output format

A sample configuration file is provided and may be used to
calibrate the devices. Running temper1 is best done from a
script called by cron. A sample script (get_temps.sh) is 
given to show how to call temper1 and using the USB bus id
to split the output to seperate files.

To run temper1 as a non-root user, you will need to add some
udev rules:

1. Add the udev rule set in /etc/udev/rules.d/ using the 60-temper.rules 
2. Add a 'temper' group (using groupadd or edit the /etc/group file)
3. Add users to the 'temper' group
4. Reload the udev rules:
    udevcontrol reload_rules
    (if that command doesn't exists then you will need to restart
     udev using the supported method for your distribution, or
     simply reboot)
5. Unplug and replug the TEMPer1 device
